This assignment will make you understand the workflow of git and GitHub better.

For this assignment, you will need to create a repo on GitHub, make branches, merge main into branches and then pull it to the main branch.

You can make any repo and it could be one of the other classes assignments you've worked on or it could be just a meme repo. What's essential is the commits. Its expected that you add a lot of commits, at least ten, including merge commits and regular commits.
