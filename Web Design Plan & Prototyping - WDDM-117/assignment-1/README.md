## Exercise 1.1 - Basic Design Elements
---
For this introductory exercise we will explore the concepts of *"positive and negative space"*, the application of colour, and typography. Refer to the BlackBoard Collaborate tutorial as a guide to complete this exercise. The required software for this exercise is Adobe XD. If you don't already have Adobe XD you can [download it here](https://creativecloud.adobe.com/apps/download/xd).

## Minimum Requirements:
---
Using your whole name, or just the initials of your name, create a graphic that balances positive and negative space. Convey this balance using greyscale, colour, typography, and the arrangement of the element in the frame of reference.

Create a single design but *implement two versions*: one in black, white and shades of grey, the other in colour. Use Adobe's online [colour wheel](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel) to help with your colour choices.

On a third art board, write down the font used, the *"colour harmony rule"* you used, and the colours used (at least three).

When submitting your file, either convert your fonts to outlines, or submit your fonts along with the Adobe XD file.

**Your work should meet the following minimum criteria:**
- Create two square art boards 600px wide by 600px tall.
- On a third art board note the colour harmony rule you used, the colours being used, and the type face used.
- The design must incorporate a typographic element.
- Show the use of positive & negative space.
- Show a greyscale version of the design.
- Show the same design on a second art board, in colour using at least three colours.
- Organize your work using named layers in Adobe XD.
- Either convert the typographic element to outlines or provide the font with your submission.
- Use Adobe's online colour wheel to help with your colour choices.
